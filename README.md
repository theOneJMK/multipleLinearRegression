# multipleLinearRegression
This repository includes a JS library to compute a multiple linear Regression from a given dataset.
The code will be made public as a node.js module.

The main concern in this project is the performance of the library.
Compared to the python library 'stats-models' this library consumes about 10 times more memory an is about 25 times slower.
I would appreciate any help from an experienced js-developer.

The results of this library are tested against pythons 'stats-models' in order to ensure valid results.

An usage example is shown in the file 'js/mylr.js' or in the 'test/integrationTest.js' file.
